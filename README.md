## hello!

I'm marco ramirez, a front-end developer located in Bend, OR. I've been passionate about web development & design since I was 14 years old. It all started with me messing around with the basics of HTML. 10 years later and I've dedicated myself to learning everything I can about front-end development, going through school and experimenting with code daily.
